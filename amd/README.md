# OpenCL Support in excavator

**Please read this document carefully, especially if you are mining Equihash-based coins.** 

This version of excavator has initial support for OpenCL devices,
including the AMD Radeon series graphics cards. This is still work in
progress and mostly optimized for RX 470/480/570/580 for now. 
If you have any questions/concerns/feedback, please feel free
to post them to:

* [excavator by NiceHash](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1777827) (bitcointalk.org)

Alternatively, you can directly email the author at:

* [zawawawawawawawawa@gmail.com](mailto:zawawawawawawawawa@gmail.com)

It is my hope that excavator would be useful for everybody with
top-notch performance, solid reliability, and exceptional flexibility,
and I am grateful to NiceHash for giving me an opportunity to work on this miner.
Enjoy!

## Prerequisites

Excavator *should* work with any OpenCL-compatible devices. For optimal performance,
however, please use AMD graphics cards with 
the GCN2 architecture or above. Excavator has been tested against 
AMD Crimson Software 16.9.2 on Windows 10 64-bit, but it should work with
any recent AMD drivers.


## Supported Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently supported:

Name | Supported devices | Wcount*1 | Pcount*2
-----------------|----------|---------|----
[equihash](#equihash) | GCN2+ | 4 to 6| 2
[pascal](#pascal) | GCN2+ | 4 | 2

*1 Recommended number of workers per device to reach optimal speeds.

*2 Number of supported parameters. Parameters are explained in details in section for each algorithm.


### <a name="equihash"></a> equihash

For Equihash-based coins, such as Zcash, you need to **run 
the miner as administrator** as excavator needs to access the graphics 
card directly. Furthermore, **driver signature enforcement needs to be 
disabled** on Windows 10 for the time being. You can deactivate
it either at startup or by running the following .bat file:

    turn-driver-signature-enforcement-off.bat

Please note that you need administrator privileges to do so and 
a restart is required after executing the .bat file. This 
requirement will be removed for the next stable version.

Parameter # | Range | Explanation
-----------------|----------|---------
1 | 0 or 1 | Disable/enable binary kernels
2 | 0 or 1 | Disable/enable the Global Data Share (requires admin privileges)


## <a name="pascal"></a> pascal

Parameter # | Range | Explanation
-----------------|----------|---------
1 | 0-âˆž | Global work size
2 | 0-256 | Local work size

If no parameters are provided, device specific defaults are used. If provided parameter is '0' then device specific default value is used.
